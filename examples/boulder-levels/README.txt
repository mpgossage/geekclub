This is the folder where your levels are saved.
If you do want to save a level manually follow these steps:
(1): Copy the level code from when you started the level.
(2): Change the number in "levels.txt" up by one. (IT IS VERY IMPORTANT YOU DO THIS OR WHEN YOU SAVE IT WILL OVERWRITE YOUR LEVEL YOU JUST ADDED)
(3): Create a plain text file (.txt) in the folder called save-[The number that is now stored in "levels.txt"].txt
